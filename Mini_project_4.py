# Question 4: Study Hours and Exam Results

# Chart Type: Scatter Plot

# A college wants to investigate whether students who study more hours tend to achieve higher marks.

# Dataset



# df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Tasks

# 1. Calculate the average marks of all students.
# 2. Identify students who scored more than 80 marks.
# 3. Find the student who studied the most hours.
# 4. Create a scatter plot with study hours on the X-axis and marks on the Y-axis.
# 5. Customize the marker color, shape, and size.
# 6. Set the X-axis limit from 0 to 10 and the Y-axis limit from 0 to 100.
# 7. Add a title, axis labels, and grid.
# 8. Analyze whether the data suggests a relationship between study hours and marks.
